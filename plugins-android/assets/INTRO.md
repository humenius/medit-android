# Welcome to MeDIT
> A Markdown editor for Android!

You can simply type your text into this window.
If you need any font attributes, you can use so called **text actions** in the toolbar below.
This allows you to write in **bold**, *italic* and many more ways - respecting Markdown specifications.

If you need to write something in LaTeX (usually math related), you can create an environment by creating a block surrounding with $$ like this

$$
1 + 2 = 3
$$

If you want to see the rendered result, tap on the button with a picture on it at the bottom right-hand corner.
